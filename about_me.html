                <a>As a passionate, goal-oriented and determined student in <strong>computer science</strong>, I have excelled within my program obtaining top grades in both my math and computer science courses. Having shown a strong work ethic and diligence within my first year, I am confident that I am prepared for a summer job where I can continue to learn more about software systems and object-oriented programming. I am eager to gain a more detailed understanding of the field by collaborating with an experienced team.

                    Being a member of the computer industry requires lifelong learning. Besides the curriculum, I create different projects on my own such as passing game development club coding challenges, participating in hackathons, etc.
                    
                    Since primary school, I was dreaming of becoming a <strong>hacker</strong>, and this is the main reason why I decided to study Computer Science. I am also participating in CTF competitions and started learning front-end. In my life or study, I always make sure that I take on new challenges and work hard on achieving them.
